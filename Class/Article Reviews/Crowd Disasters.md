## Crowd Disasters as Systemic Failures
 
####*Objective/Abstract:*
There were several goals of the paper. At the most basic level the paper sought to explain the causes of crowd disaster on July 24, 2010 at the Love Parade festival in Duisberg, Germany. More broadly, the paper sought to interpret the disaster as a systemic failure where the interaction of various factors created a systemic instability while at the same time revising some common views about the origin of crowd diasters. Finally, the paper introduced a scale reflecting how critical a crowd situation is based on observed phenomena.
 
 
####*Hypothesis:*

About the data:
The novel part about the 2010 Love Parade disaster is that the researchers did not have to rely exclusively on secondary sources such as news reports or after-the-fact recollections from participants. Instead there is a large amount of publicly available video which allows the researchers to observe events as they unfolded. 

Source Information:

* Publicly available materials, eyewitness reports amount to several hundred pages
* More than 500 video recordings
* Investigation reports by public authorities
* Media reports
* Maps from google earth of the scene
* 360 degree photographs
* Documents released by Wikipedia
* Documents released by Wikileaks

Love Parade Data:

* Electronic dance festival started in 1989 in Berlin
* August 2007 event had 1.2MM visitors, 1.4MM were expected in 2010
* 2010 venue was 100,000 sq meters 
* City restricted the number of concurrent visitors to 250,000


Disaster Data:

* 21 people died
* 500 injured


####*Contributing Factors:*

* Berlin refuses to host the Love Parade which subsequently moves between cities, creating new organizational challenges each time
* Duisberg was elected as a cutural metropole in 2010 which creates pressure to attract cultural events such as the Love Parade
* On the tunnel and the ramp in- and out- flows are not seperated which constricts movement
* There is no seperate entrance for emergency vehicles
* An evacuation study was commissioned but focused only on evacuation and did not consider crowds larger than what the city had approved
* The event was approved late which didn't give security forces enough time to plan
* Delays in leveling work caused a build-up of the crowd
* Interaction of the floats with the crowd reduced inflow
* There are communication issues among organizers and police
* Police shifts changed mid way through the event

 

####*Methods:*
Baseline methods:
 
The basic methodology in the paper consisted of reviewing video tape of the disaster from a variety of different sources. The investigating team was also able to plot the sources of various videos on a google map giving them a sense of problem from different view points.

The team discovered that rather than the disaster being a case of the crowd going irrationally "mad" at a distinct point in time, there were identifiable issues over a long period of time leading up to the reported incident.  Moreover, much of the visual evidence, such as people climbing up fences were misinterpreted.

For example, although the disaster occurred between 16:40 and 16:50 as early as 13:40 there were reports of people having difficulty breathing due to access capcity being far below demand.

Moreover, at 15:31 one of the floats had slowed down in front of the ramp obstructing in/outflows and people had started climbing the fences along the ramp to reach the festival area. Again, another example of consticted inflow and outflow.

Unfortunately, these and other signs of constricted flow were misinterpreted as signs of an unruly crowd rather than an indication that the crowd had become so dense people were having difficulty breathing.
 
 
####*Conclusions:*
 
From a high-level perspective I think that the paper did an excellent job of not only taking advantage of an abundance of public data/media, but also addressing the larger question of whether crowd disasters are inexplicable events driven by an irrational crowd.  On the contrary, the authors present a compelling narrative for the incident which shows that far from being an irrational event, there were warning signs for hours ahead of the reported deaths.  Hours beforehand people were reporting difficulty breathing, the inflow/outflow capacities were overestimated and insufficient for the number of people trying to get in and out. Finally, the authors point out that when crowd density gets too high force (somtimes perceived as pushing) travels through tightly packed bodies creating crowd turbulence. So even if no one was actively pushing others, the crowd could easily act as a conduit and even amplifier for forces exerted on it.
